Known BUGS

   o	host (connection) setting cannot be passed with an environment variable,
	so it is necessary to have a properly defined ~/.odbc.ini  file.


Changes in TSodbc version 2015.4-1

   o	Moved tests to inst/testWithMySQLserver and inst/testWithInternet.

Changes in TSodbc version 2015.1-1
	
   o	Changed Depends to Imports for RODBC.

   o	Bumped requirement for DBI up to version 0.3.1 or greater.

   o	Adjusted TSconnect() to use a string or a connection in place of a
   	driver, and renamed argument drv to q to reflect this change.

   o	Re-worked faking of DBI S4 classes and methods for RODBC S3 classes.

   o	Removed dropTStable() from the API. It is now handled by 
   	removeTSdbTables() in package TSsql.


Changes in TSodbc version 2014.4-1

   o	Added work around for RODBC 1.3-10 returning factors for (PostgreSQL)
   	double precision in R-3.1.0 but not in older R versions. This is 
	caused by an intended change to type.convert() in R-3.1.0 which was
	partially undone in subsequent R versions.

Changes in TSodbc version 2013.9-1

   o	Using TSsql split from TSdbi.

Changes in TSodbc version 2013.8-2

   o	Adjusted Depends and Imports in DESCRIPTION.

Changes in TSodbc version 2012.8-1

   o	Modified Title in DESCRIPTION file so TSdbi packages will be more
   	clearly related on CRAN listing.

Changes in TSodbc version 2012.5-1

   o	Minor tweaks for vignette check on CRAN.


Changes in TSodbc version 2012.4-1

   o	Added tfplot to Suggests in DESCRIPTION.

 
Changes in TSodbc version 2011.11-1

   o	updated maintainer email address.

   o	fixed problem that TSdoc and TSdescription were returning factors
   	rather than character.

   o	added dbRemoveTable() for DBI consistency (uses RODBC sqlDrop()).

Changes in TSodbc version 2011.8-2

   o	fixed method signature for TSvintages method.

Changes in TSodbc version 2011.8-1

   o	added TSvintages method.

Changes in TSodbc version 2011.3-1

   o	added support for TSrepresentation.

Changes in TSodbc version 2010.10-1

   o	added method dropTStable to work around problem that different database
   	engines handle capitalization in table names differently.


Changes in TSodbc version 2010.5-1

   o	Removed ... argument from TSdbi:::standardSQL function calls.

   o	Added arguments vintage and panel to TSdates() to correspond
	to TSdbi changes.

   o	Modified vintage aliases to work for each series rather than globally. 
	(So "current" might refer to different vintages for different series.)
	The main changes are in the TSdbi package, but the vintageAlias and
	vintages table structures also need to have an id field added.

   o	Modified indication of whether a database supports vintages and panels
	to use vintageAlias and panelAlias tables, since these are more
	fundamental than vintages and panels tables (which are only used for
	documentation of the vintages and panels).


Changes in TSodbc version 2010.3-1

   o	Fixed bug in passing of series names to generic (always used serIDs).


Changes in TSodbc version 2009.5-2

   o	Standardized NEWS format for new function news().

	place of try(). 


Changes in TSodbc version 2009.3-2

   o	fixed syntax of tests and vignette to use environment variables 
	if specified. This does not seem to work for the HOST variable, which 
	may be an odbc limitation.


Changes in TSodbc version 2009.3-1

   o	only changes to keep in sync with TSdbi.
