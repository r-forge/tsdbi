   o	This is an beta version.

   o	This package supercedes padi and dsepadi which were previously in the 
	dseplus bundle in the devel area of CRAN. (As of R-2.5.0 the CRAN devel 
	area was removed. 

   o	To the (very small) extent that there is any older news on 
	this package, it will have been included in the NEWS for the main dse 
	bundle on CRAN.

   o	some old function calls to padi.server.process and padi.cleanup.script
	were fixed to call PADIserverProcess and PADIcleanupScript. (The 
	function names were changed some time ago.)

   o	package separated from the dseplus bundle.
