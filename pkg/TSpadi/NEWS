Note

   o	This package is largely superseded by other TS* packages and I no 
   	longer have the ability to test it as extensively as previously. 
	(Tests now use only the simple file based server with a few series
	and not the Fame server with an extensive database.)

   o	See also NEWS in the TSdbi package.

	area was removed.

	this package, it will have been included in the NEWS for the main dse 
	bundle on CRAN.

   o	some old function calls to padi.server.process and padi.cleanup.script
	were fixed to call PADIserverProcess and PADIcleanupScript. (The 
	function names were changed some time ago.)

   o	package separated from the dseplus bundle.
