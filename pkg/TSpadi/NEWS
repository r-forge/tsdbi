CHANGES IN TSpadi VERSION 2007.10-1

    o This is an beta version.

    o This package supercedes padi and dsepadi which were previously in the 
      dseplus bundle in the devel area of CRAN. (As of R-2.5.0 the CRAN devel 
      area was removed. 

    o To the (very small) extent that there is any older news on 
      this package, it will have been included in the NEWS for the main dse 
      bundle on CRAN.

    o some old function calls to padi.server.process and padi.cleanup.script
      were fixed to call PADIserverProcess and PADIcleanupScript. (The function
      names were changed some time ago.)


Changes Affecting Development
 
    o package separated from the dseplus bundle.
