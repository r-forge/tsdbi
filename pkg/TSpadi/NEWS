Requested that this package be moved to the CRAN archives on 2013-03-26.
Continuing small changes for consistency with other TS* packages and 
changes in R, but testing is not being done.

Known problems:

1/ rpcgen is not easily available on all platforms.

4/ testing is leaving files zot123456b.db, simple.server.log.##### in the package directory

5/ I no longer have a Fame server to do meaningful testing.

and

Note

   o	This package is largely superseded by other TS* packages and I no 
   	longer have the ability to test it as extensively as previously. 
	(Tests now use only the simple file based server with a few series
	and not the Fame server with an extensive database.)
