\section{Introduction}
The package \pkg{TSPostgreSQL} provides methods for generics in the package 
\pkg{TSdbi}. A complete vignette, illustrating the general functionality of all
\pkg{TSdbi} extension packages is provided in the vignette 
with package \pkg{TSdata}. 
Installing that package requires that most of the \pkg{TS*}
packages are available, which will not be necessary for most users, so it may
be easier to get the pdf version of the vignette from CRAN at 
\url{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TSdata/index.html}.

The PostgreSQL  user, and password, should be set in PostgreSQL 
configuration file (.pgpass) before starting R. 
The Postgress documentation suggests that it should be
possible to get the host from the .pgpass file too, but I have not been able
to make that work. The PostgreSQL alternative to the configuration file
is to use environment variables PGDATABASE, PGHOST, PGPORT, and PGUSER.
This package (and CRAN) support another alternatively to set this information 
with environment variables  POSTGRES\_USER, POSTGRES\_PASSWD 
and POSTGRES\_HOST.
(An environment variable POSTGRES\_DATABASE can also be set, but ''test'' is
specified below.)  Below, the environment variable  POSTGRES\_USER is used to
determine how the user and password are set. If this environment variable is
empty then it is assumed the PostgreSQL mechanism will be used (i.e. the driver
consults the PG* variables or the configuration file). However, the host is
determined by the following logic:

\begin{Scode}
   user    <- Sys.getenv("POSTGRES_USER")
   host    <- Sys.getenv("POSTGRES_HOST")
   if ("" == host) host  <- Sys.getenv("PGHOST")
   if ("" == host) host  <- "localhost"  #Sys.info()["nodename"] 
   if ("" != user) passwd  <- Sys.getenv("POSTGRES_PASSWD")
\end{Scode}

See the vignette in \pkg{TSdbi} for an explanation of the underlying 
database tables.
