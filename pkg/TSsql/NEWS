Changes in TSsql version 2015.1-1

   o	Simplified TSgetSQL to always use default for retrieval and then call
   	tframePlus::changeTSrepresentation for conversion.

   o	Bumped requirement for TSdbi up to version 2014.10-1 or greater.

   o	Added DBI:: reference in inst/TSsql files so other packages
   	do not need to require(DBI) in tests.

   o	Additional namespace adjustments for checks in R-3.1.2. Moved zoo and
   	tframePlus to Imorts from Suggests.

   o	Adjusted functions createTSdbTables() and removeTSdbTables() to use
   	:: references and underlying DBI connection rather than TS* 
	connections,  so DBI, TS* packages, and TSsql do not need to be 
	attached for testing setup.

   o	Removed dropTStable() from the API. It is now handled by 
   	removeTSdbTables() which now has to handle capitalization differences.
