Changes in TSMySQL version 2010.10-1

Changes in TSMySQL version 2010.5-1

   o	Removed ... argument from TSdbi:::standardSQL function calls.

   o	Added arguments vintage and panel to TSdates() and TSexists() to
	correspond to TSdbi changes.

   o	Modified vintage aliases to work for each series rather than globally. 
	(So "current" might refer to different vintages for different series.)
	The main changes are in the TSdbi package, but the vintageAlias and
	vintages table structures also need to have an id field added.

   o	Modified indication of whether a database supports vintages and panels
	to use vintageAlias and panelAlias tables, since these are more
	fundamental than vintages and panels tables (which are only used for
	documentation of the vintages and panels).
