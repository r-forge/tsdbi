Changes in TSgetSymbol version 2012.8-1

   o	Modified Title in DESCRIPTION file so TSdbi packages will be more
   	clearly related on CRAN listing.

   o	Modified argument quote to TSget so retrieval from Yahoo defaults to
   	return Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Adjusted, as was documented
	some places but not other. Adjusted documentation for consistency.

   o	Fixed bug matching "^" in series names when quote was specified.

Changes in TSgetSymbol version 2012.4-1

   o	Added tfplot to Suggests in DESCRIPTION.
 
   o	Added argument quote to TSget for consistency with TShistQuote.

   o	Converted "default" to internally use zoo and convert to ts 
   	when appropriate.

   o	Converted to using getSymbols return.class, and added checks that
   	TSrepresentation specification is supported by getSymbols.

   o	Changed TSget to return con@dbname for TSsources in cases where it was
   	previously set to "unspecified".

Changes in TSgetSymbol version 2011.11-1

   o	Updated maintainer email address.

   o	Fixed faulty conversion from zoo to ts.

   o	Fixed vignette to use monthly rather than weekly M2. (Binding a weekly
   	and monthly series together caused problems.)

   o	Removed yahoo connection test in TSconnect as it causes more problems
   	than it likely prevents.

Changes in TSgetSymbol version 2010.11-1

   o	First release
