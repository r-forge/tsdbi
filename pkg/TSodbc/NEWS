        Known Bugs

    o host (connection) setting cannot be passed with an environment variable, 
      so it is necessary to have a properly defined ~/.odbc.ini  file.

  CHANGES IN TSodbc VERSION 2009.5-1

    o Connection now inherits from class conType. 

  CHANGES IN TSodbc VERSION 2009.3-3

    o fixed a minor problem with the vignette, using tryCatch incorrectly in
    place of try(). 

  CHANGES IN TSodbc VERSION 2009.3-2

    o fixed syntax of tests and vignette to use environment variables 
      if specified. This does not seem to work for the HOST variable, which 
      may be an odbc limitation.

  CHANGES IN TSodbc VERSION 2009.3-1

    o only changes to keep in sync with TSdbi.
