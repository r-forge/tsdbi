Known BUGS

   o	host (connection) setting cannot be passed with an environment variable,
	so it is necessary to have a properly defined ~/.odbc.ini  file.


Changes in TSodbc version 2012.3-1

   o	no real changes, but bumping version for new CRAN suitability check.

Changes in TSodbc version 2011.11-1

   o	updated maintainer email address.

   o	fixed problem that TSdoc and TSdescription were returning factors
   	rather than character.

   o	added dbRemoveTable() for DBI consistency (uses RODBC sqlDrop()).

Changes in TSodbc version 2011.8-2

   o	fixed method signature for TSvintages method.

Changes in TSodbc version 2011.8-1

   o	added TSvintages method.

Changes in TSodbc version 2011.3-1

   o	added support for TSrepresentation.

Changes in TSodbc version 2010.10-1

   o	added method dropTStable to work around problem that different database
   	engines handle capitalization in table names differently.


Changes in TSodbc version 2010.5-1

   o	Removed ... argument from TSdbi:::standardSQL function calls.

   o	Added arguments vintage and panel to TSdates() to correspond
	to TSdbi changes.

   o	Modified vintage aliases to work for each series rather than globally. 
	(So "current" might refer to different vintages for different series.)
	The main changes are in the TSdbi package, but the vintageAlias and
	vintages table structures also need to have an id field added.

   o	Modified indication of whether a database supports vintages and panels
	to use vintageAlias and panelAlias tables, since these are more
	fundamental than vintages and panels tables (which are only used for
	documentation of the vintages and panels).


Changes in TSodbc version 2010.3-1

   o	Fixed bug in passing of series names to generic (always used serIDs).


Changes in TSodbc version 2009.5-2

   o	Standardized NEWS format for new function news().


Changes in TSodbc version 2009.5-1

   o	Connection now inherits from class conType. 


Changes in TSodbc version 2009.3-3

   o	fixed a minor problem with the vignette, using tryCatch incorrectly in
	place of try(). 


Changes in TSodbc version 2009.3-2

   o	fixed syntax of tests and vignette to use environment variables 
	if specified. This does not seem to work for the HOST variable, which 
	may be an odbc limitation.


Changes in TSodbc version 2009.3-1

   o	only changes to keep in sync with TSdbi.
